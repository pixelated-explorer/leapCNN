# Hand Gesture Recognition using CNNs

This project aims to create a hand gesture recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks. 
The dataset provided classifies 10 different hand gestures, and the project will eventually recognize 
10 different hand gestures in real time with a live camera feed.


## Technologies 

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas



## Public Dataset 

The project uses the [LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) dataset from Kaggle, which contains 200,000 images of hand gestures across 10 different categories.
